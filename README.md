# Project name: BookStargram

This is for practicing Django and Python.

I implemented some basic functions in this program by using Django Web Framework

1. Create Posts
2. Read Posts
3. Update Posts
4. Delete Posts
5. Log in and Log out
6. Sign up

I made this program to Remember what you've read and Recommend the book to Others.

But the codes are not properly organized in this program.

So I'm going to update this program and make this code clean to maintain easily.
